							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[     The claim posits that a technological advance in communications media has negatively affected the quality of discourse within that media. Certainly the Internet has revolutionized both personal and public communication, and the rise of the “blogosphere” has blurred the line between public and private discourse. People use private blogs to post personal details about their own lives and to link to news articles, informational websites, and the like. Mainstream media publications such as the New York Times often have writers blog about issues in the news. The online format also makes it easier than ever to respond publicly to others’ ideas—and in turn, to respond to comments from readers. Thus, technological advances have also blurred the lines between formal and informal writing and between media creators and consumers.<br>     The claim focuses solely on how these changes have weakened public political discourse. The reasoning is that when anyone can publish ideas easily, "quality control" disappears, because the rigorous standards of traditional print journalism no longer apply. Although this is one possible outcome, the claim does not present a complete picture.<br>     First, complaints about mass media are nothing new. Thomas Jefferson observed, "The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers." Early twentieth-century social critics like H. L. Mencken decried the sensationalism of "muckraking" journalism. More recently, books such as Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death have addressed the ubiquity of television, the glut of information people now consume, and the rise of "infotainment." If public discourse is actually declining, it is not a new phenomenon caused by the rise of the blogosphere.<br>     Granted, blogs may not always undergo a rigorous editorial and fact-checking process before publication. However, this standard has declined in mainstream journalism as well. Former New York Times reporter Jayson Blair published several falsified articles. In the months leading up to the Iraq war, reporters in most U.S. mainstream news outlets failed to question the government's assertion that Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction. Continued debate between left- and right-wing bloggers, following a British newspaper's publication of the infamous "Downing Street Memo," helped keep Americans' attention on this issue. This example demonstrates that bloggers who don't need to worry about losing access to high-profile political figures may be in a better position to discuss sensitive topics. They are accountable only to their readers. Additionally, the online medium allows writers to revise and edit content quickly in response to new information or corrections from readers.<br>     Furthermore, bloggers are less subject to financial constraints than mainstream news publications and programs are. U.S. media outlets are largely owned by just a handful of major conglomerates, such as General Electric (which owns NBC), AOL–Time Warner, and Microsoft. Their dependence on advertising revenue means that advertising or corporate interests can influence news and political coverage, especially as each outlet competes with many others for people's attention. Bloggers, meanwhile, may depend somewhat on mainstream media for information (and in some cases are closely affiliated with mainstream outlets). However, most blogs are not directly tied to major corporations or as heavily dependent on advertising revenue.<br>     Finally, the emergence of the blogosphere encourages people to actively participate in discussions of news events and politics, rather than passively consuming mass media. True, many people will squander this opportunity by posting uninformed opinions or vitriolic comments. However, others may use the opportunity to research important issues, think through their positions, and respond thoughtfully—and, when necessary, critically—to others' published ideas. It is simply not valid to make a blanket claim that this new medium has weakened public discourse.]]></correctAnswer>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[Instituting a community-service requirement might benefit local teenagers and their community. The author argues that doing so would assist local charity organizations while also instilling important values. However, this argument depends on a number of unproven assumptions, and as such, it is not strong enough to justify instituting the requirement.<br>     First, the author believes the new requirement would help worthy local charitable organizations accomplish important work. The truth of this assumption depends on several other unstated assumptions. The author assumes that local charities—which are not described in detail—are accomplishing work that is of significant value to the community. However, perhaps some of the organizations labeled as charities or legally classified as nonprofits are not substantially benefiting the community. A charitable organization may have a narrow mission that only benefits a few; it may be inept or even corrupt. Without knowing more about the charities that would be affected by this measure, it is impossible to gauge the potential benefit to the community.<br>     Even if we could assume that the affected organizations' work is valuable, it doesn't necessarily follow that the new program would help them to accomplish it. The author does not provide data about how much the charities depend on volunteers, how volunteering has declined, how many charities would take part in the program, or how they would be selected. We also don't know how many students would be involved or how the high school would work with local charities to implement the program. Would the 40-hour requirement suffice to meet the organizations' needs? Do teenagers have skills that match well with the tasks that need to be done? Do the high school and the local charities have sufficient resources to implement this program successfully? The author seems to assume so, but these assumptions are groundless.<br>     The author also argues that the program would help instill important values. Would it? Again, this stated assumption rests on a number of unstated assumptions. The members of the School Board may value community service, but this does not mean everyone in Pleasantville agrees, or that the School Board has the right to impose its values on students. Young people may have other, equally valuable uses for their time. Suppose a high school student dreams of becoming an oncologist but needs high grades to win a college scholarship. What if the community-service requirement cut into this student's study time? It might make it harder for the student to pursue her dream—a dream that involves serving a larger community.<br>     Even if schools should teach the value of community service, we cannot assume the new graduation requirement would instill this value. Forty hours might not have a significant impact on students' thinking, or students might have a bad or indifferent experience working with a particular organization, or they might resent the extra demand on their time, especially if they do not get to choose where they volunteer. The goal may be laudable, but we cannot assume this is the best way to achieve it.<br>     Volunteer work may benefit the Pleasantville community and the teenagers who live there, and instituting a community-service graduation requirement may help accomplish both of those ends. For this reason, the School Board may choose to implement the new requirement. However, the author's argument is not, in and of itself, strong enough to persuade the School Board to take this action.]]></correctAnswer>

							<instructions_2><![CDATA[Some people believe it is imperative for individuals living in developed nations to reduce their energy consumption and lead a more sustainable lifestyle, given the evidence for global climate change. Others believe that such drastic lifestyle changes are unwarranted, based on the existing evidence for global climate change.<br><br>Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.]]></instructions_2>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[Climate change—and what should be done about it—has received a great deal of media attention, especially within the last decade. Environmental activists believe changing weather patterns provide irrefutable evidence for climate change (or global warming), with potentially dire consequences for the planet and for humanity. Some argue that individuals living in developed nations must make major changes to their way of living before it is too late; indeed, some claim that we have already delayed such changes so long that crisis is inevitable. Others claim that the evidence for climate change has been greatly exaggerated, or that climate change is occurring but is unrelated to (and therefore cannot be mitigated by) human activity. Thus, the latter groups do not think drastic lifestyle changes are warranted.<br>     The first view aligns most closely with my position. The evidence for climate change is substantial. NASA has documented various phenomena attributed to increasing carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere, including rising sea levels, increased land surface temperatures and ocean temperatures, and decreasing ice near the Earth's poles. If unchecked, this geologically rapid shift in temperatures could drastically reduce the global supply of potable water and the amount of land usable for agriculture, thus leading to mass starvation, along with an increase in the frequency of extreme, destructive weather events such as 2005's Hurricane Katrina.<br>     Scientific experts and government authorities have addressed this grave issue repeatedly—for instance, in extensive reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It was part of the agenda at the 2010 G8 and G20 summits. According to environmental activists, making individual lifestyle changes—such as biking to work instead of driving a car, or turning on the air-conditioning in one's home only when absolutely necessary—is an important step in reducing our collective "carbon footprint." These changes not only reduce overall energy consumption, but also set an example for others to follow.<br>     However, individual lifestyle changes will not be enough to solve this global problem. Large-scale social changes, such as reducing factory pollution, are also necessary. Furthermore, infrastructure development and policy changes at the municipal, state, and national level would help make it possible to individuals to adjust to a "greener" lifestyle. Compared to other developed nations, such as France and Japan, public transportation in the United States is woefully inadequate, making it difficult for individuals to reduce their dependence on cars and their consumption of gasoline. Many major roads do not have adequate bike paths, making it difficult for people to choose this greener form of transportation. Given what is at stake, people should still take steps to reduce their individual energy consumption—while also working to bring about these larger social changes.<br>     It is important to address claims from the other side of the debate—specifically, that climate change is being exaggerated or cannot be affected by human actions. It is true that, like any other major social movement, this one is sometimes associated with factual errors or distortions. For instance, a recent report from a United Nations panel apparently exaggerated the possibility that glaciers in the Himalayas would soon disappear; quickly rising temperatures in the 1990s led some activists to speculate (incorrectly) that the rate of temperature increase was accelerating. These distortions are unfortunate, but they are the exception and not the rule, and as such they should not be taken as grounds for dismissing the problem entirely. Internationally, the vast majority of our scientists and world leaders agree that climate change is a pressing problem that requires us to take action, individually and collectively.]]></correctAnswer>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[The survey may have uncovered a link between time spent online and two symptoms commonly associated with depression—difficulty concentrating and subjective feelings of sadness. However, the evidence provided does not make this case strongly enough to justify taking the recommended action. Several questions would need to be answered to determine whether the author's recommendation is reasonable and would lead to improved well-being.<br>     One obvious question is, <i>What else is known about the adults surveyed who reported spending 30 or more hours online per week?</i> The survey found that these adults often reported symptoms of depression, but correlation alone does not guarantee that time spent online caused these symptoms. It is quite possible that they were caused by some other factor. For instance, these adults may have had plenty of time to spend online because they were unemployed; if so, this life circumstance could be the underlying cause of their symptoms. Alternatively, perhaps adults who are predisposed to have trouble concentrating and experience feelings of sadness are also likely to spend time more online. In other words, it might be the depressive symptoms causing the behavior, rather than the behavior causing the depressive symptoms.<br>     Another important question is, <i>What did other adults surveyed report about their ability to concentrate and their subjective feelings of depression?</i> The author provides information about only those adults who reported spending 30 or more hours per week online. We cannot make a meaningful comparison between groups without raw data about all of the survey participants. For instance, the author states that "adults who spend 30 hours or more online each week were twice as likely as others to report that they 'frequently' had trouble concentrating." Does this mean that 50 percent of adults in this group frequently had trouble concentrating, but only 25 percent of adults in other groups did? Or is the ratio 2 percent compared to 1 percent? The author also states that 20 percent of adults in this group reported feeling "sad, down, or blue" at least three times in the past month. This may be significant, but if 18 percent of adults in other groups experienced these feelings with similar frequency, it probably isn't.<br>     The author also fails to mention whether the survey respondents answered any other questions pertaining to depressive symptoms and, if so, what results were found. It is possible that adults in the problematic group answered other questions in a way that showed they clearly weren't depressed. It's also possible that adults in other groups did show signs of depression that aren't mentioned here. Without more specific and complete data, we cannot meaningfully interpret the survey results.<br>     A final crucial question is, <i>How did the researchers assess the accuracy of subjects' self-reporting?</i> Survey data is often rife with inaccuracies, and this problem is compounded when subjects answer questions about subjective mental states. Did the researchers verify that subjects who reported spending a certain number of hours per week online actually did so? How did the researchers address the likelihood that different subjects would have different interpretations of subjective concepts such as "difficulty concentrating" or "feeling blue"? Were any other, more objective measures employed in addition to subjects' self-reported data? Answering these questions would help us evaluate the data the researchers collected.<br>     Spending a great deal of time online may be correlated with experiencing symptoms of depression, and for this reason, some people may choose to limit the time they spend online. However, without access to more complete data and assurances that the study was rigorous, there is no justification for recommending that everyone do so.]]></correctAnswer>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Student response (as written, including original errors): Score of 6</b><br><br>     In a country that prides itself in its personal liberties, it is tempting to constantly advocate for increased individual freedom, with the belief that people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their lives and bodies, so long as they are only hurting themselves. This argument holds that it is not fair for us to dictate such control over each other's lives. The flaw in this philosophy is that there is no way to limit the extent of damaging actions, and what may have been intended to harm only one person will also affect other people. This cannot be tolerated. When we use safety devices, we are also safeguarding our ability to contribute to our society.<br>     Intentionally foregoing simple safety measures, such as using seat belts, significantly increases the risk of serious bodily injury or death in the occurrence of an accident. By the nature of their profession, doctors and other hospital staff cannot refuse to treat and heal anyone, regardless of the origin of their injury; however, if these preventable injuries were avoided, the very same time, resources, and energy could be used to tend to others. Furthermore, by living in a civilized society, using the machines, roads, and other services provided by other members of the community, you become responsible for contributing substantially to the community whose resources you use. As an active member of the community, it is your duty to protect yourself and ensure that you are able to continue to add to the community in recompense for what you take away.<br>     Another point to recognize is the non-intrusiveness of the requirement. While ensuring that all citizens eat properly and exercise frequently would certainly be a strong limitation of their personal freedom, a seat belt does not restrict one's ability to drive or otherwise interfere with his or her life. It is a simple and nonrestrictive measure that allows the community to protect its members and assets. Intentionally endangering yourself, without any benefits, is as much a threat to your community as it is to yourself. Harm done to yourself <i>is</i> harm done to your community. This is not a limitation on activities, a ban on potentially dangerous hobbies, or any unreasonable restriction imposed by the government. It is a matter of protection against potential unnecessary damage. Because you live in a community, your life is not entirely your own. As a contributor to the community, either professionally or personally, you must accept a certain responsibility to protect yourself – to protect a community's worker, a child's parent, a friend. The community that protects and ensures our personal freedom requires, almost paradoxically, that we provide certain contributions to enable the community to flourish.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br>A 6 response presents a cogent, eloquent analysis of the issue, and will address the specific directions that are given in the task.  This particular essay is well constructed; the author begins by acknowledging arguments against compulsory seatbelt laws, then states his opinion ("The flaw in this philosophy is that there is no way to limit the extent of damaging actions, and what may have been intended to harm only one person will also affect other people"). He proceeds to support his position with compelling evidence, citing the effect upon society at large, and the relatively non-intrusive nature of seatbelts. The writing is clear, direct, and error-free, and reveals skillful use of diction. For all these reasons, this essay receives a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

							<instructions_2><![CDATA[Argument: One increasingly popular policy for promoting renewable energy is a feed-in tariff. Under such a policy, investors on any scale, from large corporations to individual homeowners, produce their own energy from solar panels installed on their property. Electricity companies are then required to purchase the energy through a long-term contract at an increased rate that would allow the investors to more than offset the cost over time. There is no denying that the initial cost of solar installation would be a burden on the investor. In strenuous economic times, both businesses and homeowners might be reluctant to make the investment, with concern that the payout could be less than sufficient or the plan might prove unfeasible. However, research has shown that a feed-in tariff plan is not only stable but also exceptionally effective, and ought to be more actively pursued.<br><br>Write a response in which you consider the assumptions made by the author in the passage. Discuss how these assumptions affect the validity of the argument and the possible implications should these assumptions be proved wrong.]]></instructions_2>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Student Response (as written, including original errors): Score of 6</b><br><br>     The argument that feed-in tariffs, as an efficient means to reduce energy bills and promote renewable energy, should be more aggressively promoted seems reasonable, but relies on several assumptions that it fails to establish. Perhaps of greatest concern is the "guarantee" that the solar panels will "more than offset the cost over time." Like any investment, it inevitably has its risks, which are compounded by the fact that the owners are forced to sign a "long-term contract" with their electricity company. The author fails to properly consider the implications, particularly concerning homeowners. While reducing energy bills in the long term might seem desirable, no consideration is given to the potential effects on the value of the house and how these types of contracts adapt to change in ownership of the house. Additionally, solar panels are machines, and like all machines, may break or be faulty to begin with. The money saved by the tariff might cover the initial cost of installation, but this assumes that no maintenance will be necessary. The author is writing with a fixed state of the establishment in mind bearing the solar panels – assuming the same owners, a lack of required maintenance, and so on. Should the solar panels break or the building be purchased, the contract would most likely continue, thus forcing the owners to either pay for the maintenance (which could negate the profit) or remain in the contract without gaining the benefits of the tariff.<br>     This is particularly concerning because the electricity companies would likely increase rates to compensate for the cost of purchasing energy – which the author also fails to take into account. Simply by reason, it can be discerned that the money to cover the electricity companies' purchasing of energy must come from somewhere. Whether by federal funding or increased rates, the burden will eventually return to the same people whose bills the feed-in tariff is supposed to lessen. It almost forces the members of the community to participate, because it increases everyone's rates, but only those who join the tariff plan accrue any benefits.<br>     Additionally, the author relies heavily upon the "effectiveness" that the unnamed research has proved. This seems vague and unconvincing, assuming that the research was performed on a wide variety of communities to ensure that the benefits it espouses would be comparable in the reader's community. Furthermore, no mention of the effects is made – the passage seems to focus entirely on the financial side of the feed-in tariff policy, rather than the environmental effects. The author does not seem to consider whether the "effectiveness" demonstrated by the research was financial, environmental, or both. It is difficult to tell for what sort of audience the author is writing. A major aspect of the feed-in tariff's policy seems to be expanding renewable energy sources, but the author assumes that this would be of little consequence to the reader. Although there is a degree of validity to the author's argument, it relies on too many crucial assumptions to present a convincing stance on feed-in tariffs.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br>In addressing the specific task directions, a 6 response presents a cogent, well-articulated examination of the argument and correctly identifies the unproven assumptions that the argument relies upon. The author successfully identifies and analyzes this argument's main contention: that feed-in tariffs should be increased as a means of promoting renewable energy sources.<br>In the opening paragraph, the essay restates the argument, and then cites its unsupported assumptions. In the following paragraphs, the author insightfully identifies flaws in the assumptions, such as the contention that solar panels will offset the cost over time.<br>Throughout the essay, the author uses well-organized paragraphs—each starts with a broad statement followed by supporting statements—and her ideas logically flow from one sentence to the next. She uses succinct, economical diction and rotates complex and simple sentences.<br>The essay concludes strongly by summarizing the major flaws in the argument, i.e. the fact that the author ignores the effects of the policy. The essay remains focused and clear throughout, earning it a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

Be sure to explain the justification of your position and cite specific examples of reasons why you believe it to be correct.]]></instructions_2>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Analyze an Issue Sample Response</b><br><br>     The basis of this issue lies in the question of whether or not parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit. Although in theory, it might seem reasonable, and even desirable, to allow parents to do what they believe to be best for their child, parents do not have unlimited control over every aspect of their child's life.  Parents do not, for instance, have a right to starve or imprison their children. The state has some responsibility toward children in general, ensuring protection for them against abuse and negligence in their rearing. Further, because children are obviously not born with all the necessary information and skills to function as independent adults, the state also insists that all children must undertake a certain number of years of education so they may acquire those skills, and the state provides free schooling for that purpose. Compulsory education does not force parents to relinquish control of their children's education (as the possibility of homeschooling shows), but it does ensure that children are given an equal opportunity to learn the fundamentals of reading, mathematics, and other subjects that allow them later to effectively follow a walk of life of their own choosing.<br>     The argument that compulsory education is tantamount to the government dictating what a child does and does not learn is fundamentally flawed, in that it does not account for parental freedom in choosing to home-school their child or to educate their child in a system other than the public one. In addition, in school associations and in electing their local representatives, parents have a degree of influence in the education the system gives their child. On the other hand, while parents may also choose to have their child instructed according to whatever doctrine or ideas they believe to be right, they must not prevent the child from learning certain fundamentals. For example, while the parents may have a right to refuse to teach a child about a philosophy they object to, they should not have the right to deny the child the opportunity to learn to read.<br>     Part of encouraging individual freedom is educating children in how to use their knowledge and skills to enjoy that freedom. Ideally, parents should not deny their child the opportunity to pursue a path of his or her own choosing by restricting the child's education. .If a child wishes to enter into business or become a doctor, a teacher, or a variety of other positions, he or she must have access to the basic education that will allow the achievement of those wishes. Compulsory education is a policy which, although seeming to limit the possibilities of how parents raise their children, in fact extends the possibilities of what the children choose to do with their lives as adults. This is a key freedom that requires protection – the right of every person to have an equal opportunity to do with his life as he pleases. This is what a basic education allows, and this is why the enforcement of compulsory education is necessary – to provide in education as in most things the proper balance between compulsion and unrestricted freedom.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br>A 6 response presents a cogent, eloquent analysis of the issue, and conveys meaning skillfully.  This essay establishes a clear, thoughtful position on the issue, basing the argument on the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, while acknowledging limitations on those rights. The writer develops the position using sound examples (extremes of parental neglect, instances of the rights of the state, possible careers a child might wish to pursue) and connects ideas logically throughout, particularly examining the tensions between the rights of parents and of the state. The writing is fluent and clear, showing good use of vocabulary and sentence structure, with few errors. For these reasons, this essay receives a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

							<instructions_2><![CDATA[Argument: The United States of America should dispense with the Electoral College. At present, the President and Vice President are selected in a process that does not give equal weight to all voters. Apart from Maine and Nebraska, states select electoral votes based upon a winner-take-all system. Because states have disproportionate populations, the weight of votes is worth more in some states than in others, particularly in swing states (in which no candidate is clearly favored). The campaign process then marginalizes large states that are considered 'safe' (such as California for the Democrats or Texas for the Republicans), with candidates focusing instead on swing states, privileging some citizens' votes over others. Additionally, the winner of the electoral vote will not always necessarily win the popular vote. This is fundamentally undemocratic and unfair, and it must be stopped.<br><br>Write a response in which you consider the proposal in the above argument, and what further information would be needed to determine its reasonableness.

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Analyze an Argument Sample Response</b><br><br>     The argument that the United States should dispense with the Electoral College, while not entirely without merit, grossly oversimplifies the matter, a fact which the author seems to attempt to conceal in an effort to strengthen the argument. To properly address the matter, the author should first address the nature of the system in a more in-depth manner, as well as demonstrate the viability of an alternative system.<br>     To begin with, the author fails to fully explore the nature of the Electoral College. Although the structure is hinted at, in order to properly demonstrate its flaws, more information about its process would be needed. The author anticipates some common knowledge concerning the electoral process in his decrying of the system. Why is it outdated? If it once served an important purpose in the past but now is no longer necessary, this could potentially serve to lend weight to the argument by demonstrating the Electoral College as obsolete. Without this, however, there is no particular reason for the reader to be swayed by the claim that it is an archaic system.<br>     The core of the argument lies in the claim that, in the current electoral process, not everyone's vote has equal weight. Again, a better explanation of the system would be necessary before such a harsh criticism as it being "undemocratic" could be taken without at least some skepticism. The author also suggests that the electoral vote has conflicted with the popular vote in the past. Yet, despite these apparent flaws, the electoral system still prevails. Perhaps the argument would carry more weight if it could demonstrate popular disapproval of the electoral system as a whole. It would be good to know what the public reaction was to instances when the electoral and popular votes were different, or to have information about public feeling about the Electoral College system as a whole. If the author of the argument could provide firm evidence that a majority of the country opposes the system and feels that it is outdated, then the argument would be much stronger than it is at present.<br>     The absence of reference to public sentiment about the system hints at support of, or at least ambivalence toward, the system. Significantly, the author provides no suggestions for or information about alternative systems. If the author had proposed such an alternative, perhaps the argument as a whole might retain some validity. As it stands, however, the argument raises some one-sided concerns about the Electoral College process, but it fails to prove that the College is undemocratic or in need of abolishing.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br>In addressing the specific task directions, a 6 response presents a cogent, well-articulated examination of the argument and clearly identifies relevant arguments. Here the author identifies and analyzes the flaws in the argument's main contention, that the Electoral College is undemocratic and in need of abolition. He successfully challenges the assertion that the current system is undemocratic by noting the absence of public rejection of the system and of an alternative system in the original argument. The author's arguments are logical and well linked ("To begin with," "Again," "As it stands"), and he conveys ideas fluently overall, showing facility with good standard English overall. The essay concludes strongly, showing that the argument is "one-sided" and that it "fails to prove that the College is undemocratic or in need of abolishing." The essay is focused and clear throughout and merits a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Analyze an Issue Sample Response</b><br><br>     Although it is reasonable for parents to be interested in, or even concerned about, what their children are checking out from the library, to allow parents to monitor that activity or prevent their children accessing information would be a great ethical wrong. To clarify, this view does not concerned lascivious or pornographic content—such things would be restricted by library policy in any case—but there are many issues that children might not feel comfortable discussing with their parents or would be reluctant to talk about should their parents find out.<br><br>     A classic example of this is teenage pregnancy. Regardless of personal stances on abortion, it is important for information resources to be readily available through confidential channels. The same is true of matters such as sexually transmitted diseases, depression, suicide, or other particularly sensitive subjects. To make resources available to assist youths with difficult problems or concerns would be self-defeating if young people had to announce their interest or concern, even to their parents.<br><br>     Particularly since the advent of the Internet, youths have no difficulty finding information on personal—or even taboo—subjects. Unfortunately, the Internet has also opened up a vast body of unreliable or incorrect information, which, when related to crucial topics such as those mentioned above, should not form the basis of a young person's knowledge. It is far better for children to use the library, which can evaluate the materials it receives, to search for reliable and accurate information than for them to seek it from unmonitored sources.<br><br>     Finally, it is also not the role of the library or librarian to act as censor or monitor over what children show interest in. It is the place of the library to make accurate information readily accessible to all patrons. Given the broad range of ages, maturity, and levels of parental restrictiveness, it is simply impractical and unfeasible to mandate policies restricting what information patrons can and cannot access. Many libraries do have graphic material, and it would be a reasonable compromise to restrict the borrowing of such materials, which clearly exist only for adult entertainment rather than for significant educational value. However, this is a decision which rests with library policy, not in the hands of a particular set of patrons wishing to exercise control over the usage of another set, even their own offspring. It is reasonable for the library to restrict access by children to erotica, but not to information of educational value, no matter how controversial it may be.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br><br>A 6 response presents a cogent, well-articulated analysis of the issue and conveys meaning skillfully. Here the test taker establishes his position on the issue of parental monitoring and restriction of what their children take from the library. He accepts parents' concerns with what their children access but shows that libraries exercise their own controls. He develops this position using good reasons, especially the reluctance of youths to discuss their deeper anxieties with their parents. He connects ideas logically and generally with fluency and a facility with varied, clear, and interesting writing. There are a few grammatical errors, as would occur under normal test conditions, and they will not detract from the score. Essays with some small errors or imperfections can still earn a score of 6. For these reasons, this essay receives a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

							<instructions_2><![CDATA[Argument: In Fall 2010, the Transportation Security Administration stepped up its security efforts in U.S. airports by incorporating random full-body searches as part of its counter-terrorism efforts. These full-body searches were a response to the refusal of some people to accept the use of full-body scanners, which were judged by some to be excessively revealing. The Chief of TSA and the Secretary of State both came forward to say that, while they acknowledge every citizen's desire for privacy, this desire must be held in balance with safety measures. However, these safety measures are not a reasonable trade for the invasion of privacy that citizens must now suffer, so the TSA must abandon such measures.<br><br>Write a response in which you consider what questions would need to be answered to determine whether or not the above criticism of the policy is reasonable. Discuss the potential impact the answers to these questions could have on the criticism.]]></instructions_2>

							<correctAnswer><![CDATA[<b>Analyze an Argument Sample Response</b><br><br>     It is well known that the threat to the safety of airline passengers is real and that the authorities must take measures to protect that safety. The above argument hinges on the perceived lack of balance between safety and privacy in enforcing airport security. In order to establish that objections to the process are defensible—and that the new safety measures need to be repealed—opponents to the measures have to demonstrate that the rights of citizens are being violated to excess with no proportional gain in security.<br><br>     The question of the violation of privacy is very much a matter of extent. For example, airline passengers now almost universally accept X-rays of luggage; no controversies are currently raging in order to prevent TSA from screening checked or carry-on luggage. On the other hand it may be that it is the physical searches and scans of the actual people that cross the line. This is a potentially more cogent argument than simply stating that things as they are not acceptable.<br><br>     This raises a second question: what would be a suitable replacement for the searches? If there is, indeed, a necessity for increased security, particularly regarding what people may be carrying on their persons, is there currently a viable alternative to the searches or body scans? If there is not, then we have to ask whether it is instead in the best interests of citizens to simply not increase security measures at all. By answering these initial questions, the author of the argument could strengthen his or her position by demonstrating what, precisely, is objectionable about the searches and what the alternatives to them are.<br><br>     Yet another question the author of the argument would need to face is how effective these searches are. If they are demonstrably ineffective, then the claim that citizens' rights are being forfeited for the sake of no significant gain would greatly improve the author's position. However, if the evidence showed that the searches have been critical in preventing numerous threats that would have gone otherwise undetected; the author would be forced to adopt a new approach to the argument.<br><br>     A final concern is the absence of detail connected with use of the new terminology. Although "full-body search" is relatively self-explanatory, the author makes no mention of the conditions under which these searches occur. The author does not indicate whether the TSA select passengers at random, a certain amount from among any given number of passengers, or if the TSA performs the full search on every passenger who refuses the scanner. The author also does not discuss whether or not children are subject to these searches or if they are an exception. If children are, indeed, an exception, then the claim that the TSA makes random searches—because it is impossible to know who precisely could be carrying illegal items—becomes much weaker.<br><br>     The author uses emotional, negative phrases such as "full-body search" and "invasion of privacy" to strengthen his or her position, because it seems that the basic argument falls down on other grounds. Therefore it is important to resolve the resulting critical questions before one can give serious consideration to a proposal such as the abandonment of the new security measures.<br><br><b>Analysis</b><br>In addressing the specific task directions, a 6 response presents a cogent, well-articulated examination of the argument and conveys meaning skillfully. The test taker identifies and analyzes the main contention of this argument—that the Transportation Security Administration is overstepping its bounds in enforcing new and more extreme security measures when screening airline passengers. She identifies weaknesses in the argument—notably that the author of the argument makes general assertions, gives too few details about the procedures, and uses emotional terms that invite negative reactions. This test taker uses rhetorical questions, but only sparingly, to focus on key elements, develops ideas cogently and organizes them well, and provides good support for them. She is fluent, uses precise vocabulary and sentence variety, and shows facility with the conventions of Standard English. There are a few grammatical and punctuation errors, as would occur under normal test conditions, and they will not detract from the score. Essays with some small errors or imperfections can still earn a score of 6. The essay is focused and clear throughout, earning it a score of 6.]]></correctAnswer>

Moreover, order of precedence potentially determines the order of succession for heads of state removed from office or incapacitated, although the two terms are not often interchangeable. Universities and the professions frequently have their own rules of precedence, applied parochially and based on professional rank, with each rank being ordered within itself by seniority, meaning the date one attains that rank.</text>

						<text><![CDATA[In <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, Jane Austen rejects and satirizes English Jacobin political Gothicism. In the unfamiliar setting of Northanger Abbey, Catherine makes many dramatic mistakes in interpretation. Lacking the worldly experience to chasten and direct her subjective, "natural" sympathies and imagination, she relies on what she has learned in reading novels and interprets her present world as if it were a Gothic romance: Catherine sees General Tilney as a tyrant and Northanger Abbey as a facade for secret horrors. Catherine's suitor and Tilney's son, Henry, recognizes her error and reminds her of the current social and political reality, his speech asserting a particular view of the present constitution of Britain and thus of British society. Critic Goldstein found it characteristic of Austen's disregard of novelistic excess that Henry's perception of Catherine's error does not diminish the value of her character in his eyes, nor lead him to reject her as a prospective wife—which would be too indicative of a mere Gothic novel.]]></text>

Floodwaters will then provide a favorable environment for rice growth, help control weeds and stabilize soil ammonium nitrogen. In order to aid weed control of both broadleaf and grass, and to reduce nitrogen losses, establish the first flood within 3 to 5 days after pre-flood nitrogen applications. The depth of the flood is as important as its timing. The flood should be no deeper than 6 inches; <b>deeper water interferes with proper tillering of rice.</b> Generally, a 2-inch flood on the upgrade side will prevent too-deep water if the levees were properly surveyed.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Declassification of government documents has shed new light on the events comprising the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. Prior to the accessibility of these records, the only sources of account of the Crisis for scholars and historians were the personal memoirs and narratives of the officials who served under Kennedy and Khrushchev during this period. Many of the declassified documents are transcriptions and notes of meetings between members of the CIA and President Kennedy's cabinet, as well the president himself. The revelations in these documents have demonstrated the inadvertent inaccuracies and intended obscurities inherent in the first-person narratives of the Crisis and have aided historians from all three countries involved in the Crisis to get a more authentic representation of what truly transpired, and for what reasons. Of perhaps the most interest to historians are declassified correspondences between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev that challenge the idea that the height of the Crisis extended only over the course of thirteen days. Indeed, these letters indicate that the Crisis was far from resolved by Khrushchev's October 28 decision to withdraw the Soviet missiles from Cuba; instead it endured far into the following month, while America slept fitfully under the illusion of peace.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Declassification of government documents has shed new light on the events comprising the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. Prior to the accessibility of these records, the only sources of account of the Crisis for scholars and historians were the personal memoirs and narratives of the officials who served under Kennedy and Khrushchev during this period. Many of the declassified documents are transcriptions and notes of meetings between members of the CIA and President Kennedy's cabinet, as well the president himself. The revelations in these documents have demonstrated the inadvertent inaccuracies and intended obscurities inherent in the first-person narratives of the Crisis and have aided historians from all three countries involved in the Crisis to get a more authentic representation of what truly transpired, and for what reasons. Of perhaps the most interest to historians are declassified correspondences between John F.

						<text><![CDATA[Two of the most revered poets in American history, Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, are seemingly a study in contrast. But the nature in which both nineteenth-century poets chose to lead their lives, which has deceivingly set them apart in the eyes of many historians, is actually their greatest similarity. Whitman's energetic wanderings around the United States and his informal, inquisitive disposition were directly reflected in his style of verse and subject matter. He was a self-proclaimed man of the people, larger than life, interested in breaking down social preconceptions and boundaries, using his explorations of reality and the world at large in an attempt to translate the language of the universal soul. As he was open to the world, so was his style of poetry; rambling and unconstrained, yet accessible. While Whitman's style was a mirror of his external forays, Emily Dickinson's travels into the dark inner realms echoed throughout her writings. Where Whitman blazed an ample path for the masses, the introspective Dickinson beckoned them to get lost in her spare verse. Deftly picking and choosing her words, her vivid, aphoristic style was the distillation of a life spent in solitary contemplation and experimentation with form. The common bond shared between Whitman and Dickinson was each poet's obsessive drive for self-discovery. Though both poets' explorations into meaning took them on two very different journeys, the courage required for those personal voyages was tantamount, and the resulting work was an unconventional brilliance that still exerts its influence upon American poetry to this day.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Martha Graham is remembered in the dance community as a pioneer of modern dance choreography. However, it was her desire to live on as a dancer. She danced first as a member of the Denishawn Company, put on solo performances in New York, and later danced at Radio City Music Hall. She gave lessons in movement and modeled coats to fund her own dance company. It was with this company that her eclectic and radical technique made its mark on modern dance history.<br><br>Graham was by no means the first dancer to deviate from the strict classical ballet techniques of the early 20th century. Many young American women were also making their own variations to the standard dance style. But Graham's alterations of sharp, jagged movements and sweeping floor work reformed the whole of modern dance theory and the very notion of what a dancer was. Her signature style continues to permeate the work of contemporary dance and influence modern choreographers, although some, such as Taylor and Cunningham, both former members of Graham's company, have disowned her intense manner of teaching and technique.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The culture surrounding popular music is constantly under scrutiny because of its influence on the already unpredictable teenage society, a group that comprises the main consumers of this type of music. Critics of pop music fear the sway that icons in this genre hold over adolescents because of the preconceived negative stereotypes these icons represent. The nature of the language used in the lyrics and the actions documented in the lifestyles of the artists serve to feed this concern. Pop music is subsequently held responsible for many of the turbulent issues facing teenagers. However, this unease and the oversimplified views held by older generations do not deter record labels and artists from continuing to create and mass-market not only music, but also behavior to the youth of the world.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Everything that is made in nature is capable of biodegrading back into nature to produce new substances or materials from the old. Biodegradable products can be broken down efficiently if given the appropriate environment to do so. The process in its natural form is perfect and omnipresent. Human participation in this process creates certain materials incapable of decomposing. The biodegradability of an item relies on three major factors. First, anything that is made up of natural substances or materials will return to the earth in some way, providing it has not been altered by manmade substances. The microorganisms responsible for the breakdown procedure do not exist for unnatural materials. Biodegradable products must also break down within a reasonable period of time. Finally, the substance or material must break down into a form that is not harmful to the ecosystem such as water, carbon dioxide, and natural minerals.]]></text>

In our contemporary world, we can see this as the revolutionary influence that the digital age has brought to the library world.

To him, the dichotomy of internet versus library would itself be the crisis; librarians should not be asking how they can adapt to the digital age, with its new challenges and demands, nor should they be worrying about the development of information storage systems beyond "their" realm of the book and physical library.

						<text><![CDATA[The Middle English language arose in the years following the Norman Invasion in 1066 and lasted until the late fifteenth century; its development over these years was marked by a sizable reduction in inflected forms, continental influences on vocabulary, and a gradual disappearance of several characters, including <i>ash</i>, <i>eth</i>, <i>yogh</i>, <i>thorn</i>, and <i>wynn</i>. Of these, the thorn is notable for its particularly unusual decline in English. Borrowed from the Old Norse runic alphabet, thorn (Þ þ) is a dental fricative, similar to <i>th</i> in Modern English, and can be either voiced (as in <i>th</i> in English <i>breathe</i>) or voiceless (as in <i>th</i> in English <i>breath</i>). By the fourteenth century, however, <i>th</i> was being increasingly used in thorn's place, and the shape of thorn itself began to change, coming to resemble most closely the letter <i>Y</i>, which would later replace thorn entirely. This led to confusion surrounding the late Middle and early Modern English definite article <i>ye</i>, which is even now frequently used anachronistically in names of establishments to give them an "older" or more rustic feel. However, the <i>ye</i> found in texts from the late Middle English is, in fact, identical to <i>the</i> in pronunciation -- <i>Y</i> was simply used as a replacement for thorn in writing, in large part due to the lack of thorn on printing presses imported from the continent.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The Middle English language arose in the years following the Norman Invasion in 1066 and lasted until the late fifteenth century; its development over these years was marked by a sizable reduction in inflected forms, continental influences on vocabulary, and a gradual disappearance of several characters, including <i>ash</i>, <i>eth</i>, <i>yogh</i>, <i>thorn</i>, and <i>wynn</i>. |~Of these, the thorn is notable for its particularly unusual decline in English.| Borrowed from the Old Norse runic alphabet, thorn (Þ þ) is a dental fricative, similar to <i>th</i> in Modern English, and can be either voiced (as in <i>th</i> in English <i>breathe</i>) or voiceless (as in <i>th</i> in English <i>breath</i>). By the fourteenth century, however, <i>th</i> was being increasingly used in thorn's place, and the shape of thorn itself began to change, coming to resemble most closely the letter <i>Y</i>, which would later replace thorn entirely. This led to confusion surrounding the late Middle and early Modern English definite article <i>ye</i>, which is even now frequently used anachronistically in names of establishments to give them an "older" or more rustic feel. However, the <i>ye</i> found in texts from the late Middle English is, in fact, identical to <i>the</i> in pronunciation -- <i>Y</i> was simply used as a replacement for thorn in writing, in large part due to the lack of thorn on printing presses imported from the continent.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Modern anthropology in the United States and the United Kingdom is frequently divided into four sub-fields: cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, physical anthropology, and archeology. Likely as a result of the diverse origins of the field as a whole, this division has led to noticeable rifts in the field. In many universities in the UK, these sub-fields are separated into entirely different departments -- while physical anthropology, which focuses on the study of human populations from an evolutionary perspective, is sometimes absorbed into other departments, linguistics (which studies human language), archeology (the study of human material culture through artifacts), and cultural or social anthropology (commonly referred to as simply "anthropology," it focuses on the study of human culture through ethnography) all possess departments of their own.<br><br>Although these distinctions have allowed for the development of unique techniques and theories within each sub-field, at the same time this separation of sub-fields has perhaps gone too far in disassembling the field of anthropology.

						<text><![CDATA[A main component of NASA's search for evidence of life on Mars is the identification of biosignatures. The most common of these indicative markers of extant or extinct life are carbonate minerals, which are formed when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacts with other minerals and liquid water. A widely held belief among astrobiologists is that proof of running or standing liquid water can be construed as diagnostic evidence of the existence of life. It has been established that a large portion of the red planet's surface contains areas of frozen water, leading some scientists to theorize that the climate of ancient Mars was a greenhouse-like atmosphere heavy with carbon dioxide. In this type of atmosphere, the existence of vast oceans similar to those of Earth would have been a very real possibility. Images of the landscape of Mars have lent support to these theories. Massive surface erosions resembling the Grand Canyon and land features that appear to be dried-up sea floor suggest that liquid water was indeed present on Mars at one point in the planet's history. But recent findings on the planet paint a different picture. Though trace carbonates have been identified, the amounts are not commensurate with the prolonged existence of large bodies of flowing liquid water.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Light has been used as a beacon to mariners for thousands of years, for as long as man has taken to the sea. To the uneducated eye each of these lighthouses, despite their distinct locations, seems to have irrelevant variations on a homogeneous design. However, nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>Each lighthouse has its own characteristic intervals of light and eclipse. These intervals, known as nightmarks or signatures, are set in specific patterns defined with such names as <i>flashing</i>, <i>occulting</i>, <i>group flashing</i>, or <i>group occulting</i>. What distinguishes each lighthouse is the rate of repetition for the intervals of flash and eclipse or fixed flashing. This unique repetition rate is called a period, and each lighthouse's period is charted in U.S. Coast Guard publications known as <i>light lists</i>. In addition to a lighthouse's nightmarks, its daymarks are included in these charts as well. Smart sailors still value these charts because they know that long after their fragile radios and radar rust into uselessness, the stalwart lighthouses will still be standing tall.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[~In the Ptolemaic cosmology the earth is regarded as a fixed point with the other planets revolving around it.| One reason for supposing that the earth is not moving is that if you drop an object it falls straight to the ground; if the earth was moving, Ptolemy reasoned that it would fall in a different place because the earth would move in between when you released the object and when it hit the ground. In fact, this is incorrect as can be demonstrated by dropping an object (keys for example) while walking. The keys do not fall to the ground at the place you stood when you released them but at the place you are, roughly speaking, when the keys hit the ground. In other words the keys move with you after you let them go, as long as you keep going with the same speed. This was first explained by Galileo in his famous work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems," When the keys are released they have same forward velocity with respect to the earth as you, the walker, do. In addition they experience a gravitational force pulling them down. So they drop to the ground while maintaining the same forward velocity, assuming we can neglect the drag of the air, and arrive at the same place as your feet. In a similar manner Galileo argued that you would not be able to tell if the earth is moving or not by experiments done on earth, thereby removing an important obstacle to the heliocentric (sun centered) cosmology of Copernicus. Today the principle that the laws of mechanics are the same in any frame moving with a constant velocity is called "Galilean invariance," and would play a crucial role in Einstein's development of special relativity.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) estimates music piracy is the source of over, $4 billion each year in lost profits. Though <i>music piracy</i> is a general term that encompasses a broad array of illegal practices involving the duplication and distribution of recorded music (such as counterfeiting and bootlegging for personal monetary profit), the one area of piracy that occupies the majority of the nation's attention is the contentious practice of music file sharing on peer-to-peer (P2P) websites. Despite the RIAA's recent crackdown on illegal file sharing by levying heavy fines against offenders, P2P websites are still thriving. Though there is a small minority of the file-sharing population who truly believe they should not have to pay to listen to their favorite music, this percentage hardly occupies the lion's share of illegal downloaders. So why are so many people breaking the law? The RIAA equates the illegal downloading of an album of music to the act of shoplifting that same album from a record store, and it has a logically sound argument. However, the devious act of physically pilfering something from a record store, and all the tangible consequences it entails, is hardly present in the action of pressing a keyboard button from the repose of one's home.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The Gaelic revival movement of late 19th and early 20th century Ireland attracted some of the leading social, intellectual, and political figures of the time to the study of Gaelic. Primarily nationalistic in purpose, and located within the context of the Irish struggle for independence, the revival advocated the use of the traditional Irish language, Gaelic, in lieu of English. |~It was felt that a more robust use of a national language was necessary to crystallize Ireland's fractious sense of national identity.| The idea was not without parallel; modern Israel rescued its traditional language, Hebrew, from what was exclusively academic and liturgical use, and reintroduced it into an active, living vernacular in the newly independent state of Israel. Prior to this unqualified success, however, was Ireland's attempted linguistic revival, which met with more debatable results. While many writers did incorporate Gaelic, and sometimes even write in it, English is still far more prevalent, except in isolated, rural areas on the western coast, and did not become the primary native language of subsequent generations. |~This arrestingly similar set of historical and cultural circumstances, coupled with different results, subverts the notion that language and cultural identity are inseparable.| The writers and intellectuals that did study Gaelic did so primarily because it provided a romanticized connection to their heritage, not because they wished to integrate it into the fabric of their daily lives.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Although viticulture was already an established trade in many parts of the world, until the 1970s, New World wine -- particularly that of California -- was not taken seriously internationally, especially in France. Steven Spurrier, a British expatriate and Parisian wine merchant, organized The Judgment of Paris in 1976, in which a panel of nine French judges selected Californian wines for the best cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. It was difficult to dismiss the results; only the scores of top expert French judges had been used in the final tally. Furthermore, the Californian wines had been transported in personal luggage while the French bottles had been properly stored locally. Spurrier later admitted that he had been certain of the superiority of French wine and had done his best to tilt the contest in their favor.<br><br>As news began to spread of the results, the impact of the tasting became apparent. Leaders of the French wine industry were outraged at the results, and the French press was both slow to respond and dismissive of the event. The only journalist who witnessed the event, George M. Taber of Time magazine, published an article about the tasting and word quickly spread. Viticulture in California spread rapidly, and exports to many countries besides France skyrocketed. Many criticisms of the methodology of the tasting were soon raised, particularly the assertion that French wines aged better than those of California. However, repeat blind tastings in 1978, 1986, and 2006 of the same vintages all favored the same Californian wines.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Although viticulture was already an established trade in many parts of the world, until the 1970s, New World wine -- particularly that of California -- was not taken seriously internationally, especially in France. Steven Spurrier, a British expatriate and Parisian wine merchant, organized The Judgment of Paris in 1976, in which a panel of nine French judges selected Californian wines for the best cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. It was difficult to dismiss the results; only the scores of top expert French judges had been used in the final tally. Furthermore, the Californian wines had been transported in personal luggage while the French bottles had been properly stored locally. Spurrier later admitted that he had been certain of the superiority of French wine and had done his best to tilt the contest in their favor.<br><br>As news began to spread of the results, the impact of the tasting became apparent. Leaders of the French wine industry were outraged at the results, and the French press was both slow to respond and dismissive of the event. The only journalist who witnessed the event, George M. Taber of Time magazine, published an article about the tasting and word quickly spread. Viticulture in California spread rapidly, and exports to many countries besides France skyrocketed. Many criticisms of the methodology of the tasting were soon raised, particularly the assertion that French wines aged better than those of California. However, repeat blind tastings in 1978, 1986, and 2006 of the same vintages all favored the same Californian wines.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[Literature is frequently a crucible through which the practice of censorship is refined. A controversial text occasions a public forum for a culture to articulate its moral standards and values. When James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> was first published in <i>The Little Review</i> in the United States, it provoked outrage from some readers who felt its content was obscene in nature. When the publisher tried to import copies of the novel into the US, they were seized by customs on the grounds that the novel was obscene. The case went to trial, with the U.S. attorney contending that the book was obscene and subject to seizure. The presiding judge felt differently. His justification for the ruling was that after reading the work in its entirety, and not merely the excerpts that had been found objectionable, the work was clearly not written with pornographic intent. He stated that nowhere does it produce "sexually impure and lustful thoughts." Pursuant to this, the book was not, objectively speaking, obscene. When the graphic passages were read, in the context of the novel as a cohesive, artistic whole, the effect did not tend to function as an "aphrodisiac," but it was "emetic" at times. The same could be said for scientific and medical texts dealing with human anatomy and sexuality, as well as classic works of Greco-Roman literature. As a result of this ruling, censors would now have to account for not only community standards of morality, but also the text's effect on the average reader, as well as the work in its entirety.]]></text>

Though the oldest reference to the monster can be traced back as far as 565 ce, the present incarnation of "Nessie" first caught the modern public's eye in April of 1933, shortly after local hotel owners Mr. and Mrs. John Mackay reportedly spotted, in their own words, "an enormous animal rolling and plunging." They detailed their incident to the <i>Inverness Courier</i>, and suddenly the Loch Ness monster was plucked from historical obscurity to be reborn in the pages of the world news. Since then there have been innumerable hoaxes, unexplained sightings, and serious scientific investigations that have turned up some interesting, yet inconclusive evidence. Recently, after the most technologically advanced search to date, a group of researchers working for the BBC concluded that the creature simply does not exist. But the daunting evidence of the researchers has seemingly not deterred the legions of tourists and part-time Nessie hunters. Apparently, as long as the slightest possibility of Nessie being real has existed, the hotels around the Loch, as they have been since 1933, will be full of intrigued souls hoping to catch just a glimpse of a real-life monster.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, objects at different gravitational potentials or observers in motion experience variability in the speed of time. Where gravity is stronger, time moves more slowly; similarly, as an object's speed increases, its relative rate of time passage decreases. Atomic clocks moving at high velocities, such as on airplanes, or at high physical elevation have demonstrated these shifts in time. Even short distances, such as an upstairs bedroom or minor speeds, such as 10 meters per second, can demonstrate variance in the speed of time. This would appear to apply to normal biological processes: one's feet age more slowly than one's head as one's feet are more affected by Earth's gravitational pull. Living at higher altitudes, whether in mountains or in the penthouse of a skyscraper, also ages a body faster than spending more time closer to the ground. Objects in motion, even at a casual pace, would appear to a stationary observer to age more slowly as well. However, although the difference in perceived time is measurable, it is very small—about 100 nanoseconds over 100 years, so it's unlikely to entice anyone to give up their top floor corner office or mountaintop cabin to avoid a wrinkle or gray hair before its natural time.]]></text>

							<choice>It is necessary to use products to care for the skin near your face to keep your body aging consistently.</choice>
							<choice>Objects in motion and at a higher altitude experience time shifts more dramatically than objects near the ground or at rest.</choice>

Now popularly remembered as the leader of the Knights of the Round Table, and the basis for one of the most famous cycles in European literature, Arthur arises from a mix of history and legend--a mix which countless scholars have questioned, theorized, and argued. Dated to the early sixth century, much of what is posited about his existence lies in his connection to other, more factually determined events, such as the Battle of Badon Hill, popularly hailed as Arthur's great victory over the Saxon invaders, which is known to have been a historical battle between the Britons and Saxons in the late fifth or early sixth century. The leader of the victorious Britons is, however, uncertain. Literary references to Arthur specifically are from much later texts (and references to him as "King" even later), many of whose reliability is highly suspect, and many of the stories about him are now accepted as borrowed from the deeds of other figures or entirely fabricated.

						<text><![CDATA[The title <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i> ("Last of the Romans") has been attributed to various men in history who were seen to exemplify the greatest characteristics and values of Roman culture, and whose deaths were seen to be also the death of those traits. Most of the figures bearing the name died in the period of the late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. Flavius Stilicho, Flavius Aetius, and Flavius Belisarius were all called <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i> for their tactical prowess as military generals, whereas Boethius and Pope Gregory I became known as <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i> for their theological and philosophical works. Justinian I bore the name for his administrative skills and as the last Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire to speak Latin natively, but Romulus Augustus and Julius Nepos gained the title by their claims to being the final Emperor of the Western Roman Empire. As can be seen from these few examples, there was no clear definition of what made a man <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i>, and, indeed, many different men were awarded the title for many different reasons--there was no official declaration, simply by popular or individual acclamation. It is ironic, however, that the first man to call someone <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i> was Julius Caesar, who used the term to refer to Marcus Junius Brutus as the final embodiment of the spirit of Rome--Brutus would later become the most famous of Caesar's assassins.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The phonograph cylinder was a remarkable invention that allowed sounds to be recorded and reproduced--the earliest instrument to do both (Édouard--Léon Scott de Martinville created a phonautograph that could record sound in a visible format, but could not play it back). First invented by Thomas Edison in 1877, the phonograph cylinder was wrapped in a scratchable medium and then rotated under a stylus that was attached to the speaking tube. When sound entered the tube, the attached diaphragm would vibrate, causing the point of the stylus to create indentations of varying depths; meanwhile, the cylinder was rotated by a hand crank at a rate of 60 revolutions per minute. The cylinder could then be played back by drawing a lighter stylus along the indentations that caused the diaphragm of a second tube, the speaking tube, to vibrate, replicating the recorded sounds. Over time, the phonograph slowly evolved. Cylinders were wrapped in wax instead of with tin foil, a motorized crank and more effective recording media were developed, and the cylinder itself was replaced with a disc that allowed for more durable creations. These evolved into record players as we know them.]]></text>

						<text><![CDATA[The "Oxford comma," also known as the "serial comma," is a comma used before a coordinating conjunction before the last item in a list of three or more. For example, in "the bus arrives on the hour and every fifteen, thirty, and forty-five minutes after the hour," the Oxford comma may be seen following <i>thirty</i>; without the Oxford comma, the phrase would be "the bus arrives on the hour and every fifteen, thirty and forty-five minutes after the hour." There are no definitive grammatical rulings on when it should be used and by whom, although journalists rarely make use of it. While it is not always necessary, it can prevent otherwise ambiguous statements (for example: "they hired the two brothers, David and James," in which they hired two men, versus "they hired the two brothers, David, and James," in which they hired two brothers plus David and James, four in total). Therefore, writers should be aware of its use even if they abstain from it in unambiguous cases.]]></text>
